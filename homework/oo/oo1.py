# Here's an example of a class that represents a person
# with a name and age.  The class has a method that returns
# the person's name and age as a string.
#
# class Person:
#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age
#
#     def get_name_and_age(self):
#         return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."
#
# # Create a Person object and print the result of calling
# # its get_name_and_age method.
# person = Person("Joe", 34)
# print(person.get_name_and_age())
#

# 1. Write a class called "Car" that has the following properties:
#    - a "color" property that is set in the constructor
#    - a "speed" property that is set in the constructor
#    - a "description" method that returns "{color} car going {speed} mph"
#    - a "accelerate" method that increases the speed by 1
#    - a "brake" method that decreases the speed by 1
#    - a "stop" method that sets the speed to 0

# Here's an example of using the class Car:
# car = Car("red", 50)
# print(car.description())
# car.accelerate()
# print(car.description())
# car.brake()
# print(car.description())
# car.stop()
# print(car.description())

# 2. Write a class called "Rectangle" that has the following properties:
#    - a "width" property that is set in the constructor
#    - a "height" property that is set in the constructor
#    - a "area" method that returns the area of the rectangle
#    - a "perimeter" method that returns the perimeter of the rectangle
#
# Here's an example of using the class Rectangle:
# rectangle = Rectangle(10, 20)
# print(rectangle.area())
# print(rectangle.perimeter())
