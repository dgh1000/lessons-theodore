# Topics covered:
# 1) three forms of range()
# 2) using range() both to construct a list and to iterate.
# 3) three forms of slices

# Prerequisites: initial exposure to range, slices, and
# for loops.

# Question #1:
# What does the following code print?
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)

# Question #2:
# What does the following code print?
# for i in range(2, 12):
#     print(i)

# Question #3:
# What does the following code print?
# for i in range(0, 13, 2):
#     print(i)

# Question #4:
# What does the following code print?
# for i in range(12, -1, -2):
#     print(i)

# Question #5:
# What does the following code print?
# my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(my_list[1:4])

# Question #6:
# What does the following code print?
# my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(my_list[:3])

# Question #7:
# What does the following code print?
# my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(my_list[3:])

# Question #8:
# What does the following code print?
# my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(my_list[0:5:2])

# Question #9:
# What does the following code print?
# my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(my_list[::2])

# Question #10:
# What does the following code print?
# my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(my_list[4:1:-1])

# Question #11:
# What does the following code print?
# my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(my_list[::-1])
