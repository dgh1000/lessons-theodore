# Topics covered: 
# 1) three forms of range()
# 2) using range() both to construct a list and to iterate. 
# 3) three forms of slices

# Prequisites:
# 1) basic familiarity with lists and for loops.

# Question #1:
#
# 1) Write a for loop with range() that prints the numbers 0
#    through 9.
# 2) Then print the numbers 2 through 11. 
# 3) Then print the numbers 0, 2, 4, etc. up to 12. 
# 4) Then print the numbers 12, 10, 8, etc. down to 0. 

# Question #2:
#
# 1) Print the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Note you are printing a
#    list, not a number on each line. 
# 2) Now use range() to construct the same list and print it.

# Question #3:
#
my_list = [-1, 7, 42, 0, 9]

# 1) Print the list [7, 42, 0] using a slice of the
#    form my_list[A:B] where you substitute the correct
#    values for A and B.

# 2) Print the list [-1, 7, 42] using a slice with
#    only one number in it (but still has a colon).
#    Hint: you want to use the form of the slice that
#    starts at the beginning of the list by default

# 3) Print the list [0, 9] using a slice with
#    only one number in it (but still has a colon).
#    Hint: you want to use the form of the slice that
#    ends the new list at the end of my_list by default.

# 4) Print the list [-1, 42, 9] using a slice with
#    three numbers in it.

# 5) Print the list [7, 0] using a slice with
#    three numbers in it.

# 6) Print the list [0, 42, 7] using a slice with
#    three numbers in it.

# 7) Print the list [9, 0, 42, 7, -1] using a slice with
#    two colors and a single number.
