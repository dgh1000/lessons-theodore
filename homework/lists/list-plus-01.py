# EXAMPLE A:

# my_string1 = "Hi there."
# my_string2 = "How are you?"
# combined = my_string1 + my_string2
# print(combined)

# 3 + 4 = 7
# coding numbers, strings, lists, 
# what + does depends on the type on each side of the plus
# if both are numbers, it adds them
# if both are strings, it combines them: concatenation
# if both are lists, it combines them: concatenation

# Question 1:
# Uncomment example A and run it. First predict what it will do.
# -  It will print my_string1 and my_string2 right next to each other

# Question 2:
# Explain in your own words what the code in EXAMPLE A does.
# - my_string1 and my_string 2 are assigned values and a new variable is created 
# that adds both my_string1 and my_string2 together and then the final line prints it.

# EXPLANATION
# The + operator is used to combine strings. It is called
# "concatenation". The result is a new string that is the
# two strings combined.

# EXAMPLE B:

# my_list = [10, 3, 13, -15, 20, -215]
# my_list2 = [12, 1, -5, 6, 8]
# combined = my_list + my_list2
# print(combined)

# Uncomment example B and run it. First predict what it will do.
# - it will print all of the values of both lists together (I was wrong)
# Question 3:
# Explain in your own words what the code in EXAMPLE B does.
# - it prints both lists next to each other
# EXPLANATION
# The + operator is can also be used to combine lists. 
# Note that it has *three* purposes: 
# 1. to add numbers
# 2. to combine strings
# 3. to combine lists
# Example B shows how to combine two lists. The result is
# a new list that is the two lists combined.

# Question 4:
# Make two new lists. Combine them and print the result.
# Try combining them in the opposite order. What happens?

my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
my_list2 = [6,7,8,9,10]
combined = my_list2+ my_list
print(combined)
