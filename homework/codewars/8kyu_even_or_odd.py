# # Extra homework:

# # 1. Write a function that returns "4" if a number is divisible by 4 and "3" if it's divisible by 3. Return "3 and 4" if it's divisible by both.
# # Call your function with appropriate numbers to test it.
# # def three_four(number):
# #     if number%4 == 0 and number%3 == 0:
# #         return "3 and 4"
# #     elif number%4 == 0:
# #         return "4"
# #     elif number%3 == 0:
# #         return "3"
# #     else:
# #         return "That number doesn't work"
    
# # print(three_four(8))

# # 2. Write a function that prints 'Small' if a number is less than 10, 'Medium' if a number is between 10 and 100, and 'Large' if a number is greater than 100.
# # Call your function with appropriate numbers to test it.
# def small_medium_large(num):
#     if num < 10:
#         print('Small')
#     elif num >= 10 and num <= 100:
#         print('Medium')
#     elif num > 100:
#         print('Large')

# small_medium_large(100)
