# Uncomment the following code and run it:

# name = input("Type your name: ")
# print(name)

# Question 1: what happens when you run this code?
# Are you clear on why it works?

# Uncomment the following code and run it:

# name = input("Type your name: ")
# if name == "Alex":
#     print("You are Alex!")
# else:
#     print("You are not Alex.")

# Question 2: what happens when you run this code?
# Try it with different inputs.

# Question 3: what happens if you type "Alex"?

# Question 4: what happens if you type "alex"?

# Uncomment the following code and run it
# weapon = input("What weapon do you want? ")
# creature = input("What creature do you want to fight? ")
# if weapon == "sword":
#     if creature == "dragon":
#         print("You slay the dragon!")
#     else:
#         print("You are unable to kill the creature with your sword.")
# elif weapon == "bow":
#     if creature == "dragon":
#         print("bows don't work against dragons")
#     else:
#         print("You kill the creature with your bow.")

# Question 5: what happens when you run this code?
# Try it with different inputs. In particular try a sword
# as the weapon, try a bow as the weapon, and try something else
# as the weapon. Try a dragon as the creature, and try something
# else as the creature.

# Question 6: see if you can explain how this code works.
