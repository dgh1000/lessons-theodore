# playing with format string
# 
# Uncomment the following code and run it:

# s = "a phrase goes here"
# print(s)

# Question 1: What happens when you run this code?
# Are you clear on why it does that?

# Uncomment the following code and run it:

# x = 3
# print(x)

# Question 2: What happens when you run this code?
# Are you clear on why it does that?

# Uncomment the following code and run it:

# x = 3
# s = f"The value of x is {x}"
# print(s)

# Question 3: What happens when you run this code?

# A string with an f in front of it is called a format string.
# The special thing about it is that it can have curly braces
# inside. For example, notice the {x} in the above string.
# When the format string is evaluated, the value of x is
# inserted into the string. This is called string interpolation.

# Question 4:
# in your answer to this question, include the following line
# of code:
x = 3
# Write an assignment statement that assigns the
# string s to the string "The value of x is 3"
# using string interpolation (that is, the format string).
# You aren't allowed to use the value 3 in your answer.
# Then print s.

# Question 5:
# Uncomment the following code and run it:
# x = 3
# y = 4
# s = f"x plus y = {x + y}"
# print(s)

# What happens when you run this code?
# This demonstrates that you can put an expression inside
# the curly braces. The expression is evaluated and the
# result is inserted into the string.
