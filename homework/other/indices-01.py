# Additional homework problems

# 1. Write a function that takes in a string and returns a string made 
# from every other letter in the string. For example, given the string
# "hello", the function should return "hlo".


# 2. Write a function that takes in a string and returns a string made
# from the first three letters of the string. If the string is less than
# three letters long, the function should return the whole string. For
# example, given the string "hello", the function should return "hel".

# 3. Write a function that takes in a string and returns a string made from
# every third letter in the string. For example, given the string
# "hellothere", the function should return "hlhe". Do this three different
# ways as we discussed in class.
